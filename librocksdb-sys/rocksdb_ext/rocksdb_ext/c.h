  C bindings for rocksdb.  May be useful as a stable ABI that can be
  used by programs that keep rocksdb in a shared library, or for
  a JNI api.

  Does not support:
  . getters for the option types
  . custom comparators that implement key shortening
  . capturing post-write-snapshot
  . custom iter, db, env, cache implementations using just the C bindings

  Some conventions:

  (1) We expose just opaque struct pointers and functions to clients.
  This allows us to change internal representations without having to
  recompile clients.

  (2) For simplicity, there is no equivalent to the Slice type.  Instead,
  the caller has to pass the pointer and length as separate
  arguments.

  (3) Errors are represented by a null-terminated c string.  NULL
  means no error.  All operations that can raise an error are passed
  a "char** errptr" as the last argument.  One of the following must
  be true on entry:
     *errptr == NULL
     *errptr points to a malloc()ed null-terminated error message
  On success, a leveldb routine leaves *errptr unchanged.
  On failure, leveldb frees the old value of *errptr and
  set *errptr to a malloc()ed error message.

  (4) Bools have the type unsigned char (0 == false; rest == true)

  (5) All of the pointer arguments must be non-NULL.
