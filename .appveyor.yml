# Appveyor configuration template for Rust using rustup for Rust installation
# https://github.com/starkat99/appveyor-rust

## Operating System (VM environment) ##

# Rust needs at least Visual Studio 2013 Appveyor OS for MSVC targets.
os: Previous Visual Studio 2015

## Build Matrix ##

# This configuration will setup a build for each channel & target combination (12 windows
# combinations in all).
#
# There are 3 channels: stable, beta, and nightly.
#
# Alternatively, the full version may be specified for the channel to build using that specific
# version (e.g. channel: 1.5.0)
#
# The values for target are the set of windows Rust build targets. Each value is of the form
#
# ARCH-pc-windows-TOOLCHAIN
#
# Where ARCH is the target architecture, either x86_64 or i686, and TOOLCHAIN is the linker
# toolchain to use, either msvc or gnu. See https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot for
# a description of the toolchain differences.
# See https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/#toolchain-specification for description of
# toolchains and host triples.
#
# Comment out channel/target combos you do not wish to build in CI.
#
# You may use the `cargoflags` and `RUSTFLAGS` variables to set additional flags for cargo commands
# and rustc, respectively. For instance, you can uncomment the cargoflags lines in the nightly
# channels to enable unstable features when building for nightly. Or you could add additional
# matrix entries to test different combinations of features.

### MSVC Toolchains ###

  # Stable 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: stable
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Stable 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: stable
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc
  # Beta 64-bit MSVC
    - channel: beta
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
  # Beta 32-bit MSVC
    - channel: beta
      target: i686-pc-windows-msvc

# Only build against the branches that will have pull requests built against them (master).
# Otherwise creating feature branches on this repository and a pull requests against them will
# cause each commit to be tested twice, once for the branch and once for the pull request.
branches:
  only:
    - master

## Install Script ##

# This is the most important part of the Appveyor configuration. This installs the version of Rust
# specified by the 'channel' and 'target' environment variables from the build matrix. This uses
# rustup to install Rust.
#
# For simple configurations, instead of using the build matrix, you can simply set the
# default-toolchain and default-host manually here.
install:
  - appveyor DownloadFile https://win.rustup.rs/ -FileName rustup-init.exe
  - rustup-init -yv --default-toolchain %channel% --default-host %target%
  - cmd: set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
  - rustup update
  - rustc -vV
  - cargo -vV
  - rustup component add rust-src
  - for /f %%i in ('rustc --print sysroot') do set RUST_SRC_PATH=%%i\lib\rustlib\src\rust\src
  - cmd: set RUST_BACKTRACE=1
  - cmd: set RUSTFLAGS=-C target-feature=+crt-static

## Build Script ##

cache:
  - '%USERPROFILE%\.cargo'

# Uses 'cargo build' to build. Alternatively, the project may call rustc directly or perform other
# build commands. Rust will automatically be placed in the PATH environment variable.
build_script:
  - cargo build --all --verbose --release

# Uses 'cargo test' to run tests and build. Alternatively, the project may call compiled programs
# directly or perform other testing commands. Rust will automatically be placed in the PATH
# environment variable.
test_script:
  - cargo test --all --verbose %cargoflags%
